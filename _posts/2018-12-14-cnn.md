# What is CNN
Class of **Deep learning** commonly applied in computer vision and image processing.
CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. 
This means that the network learns the filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered.
This independence from prior knowledge and human effort in feature design is a major advantage.

# Steps to make a cnn model to classify wether in image there is dog or cat:



Github link for dog/cat classifier [link](https://github.com/kwatraakshay)?


* Convolution operation

* Relu Layer

* Pooling

* Flattening

* Full Connection

* optimisation of loss function

Python code block:
```python
    from keras.models import Sequential#to initialise our neural network
    from keras.layers import MaxPooling2D
    from keras.layers import Flatten
    from keras.layers import Dense#to add fully connected layer to our neural neetwork
    from keras.layers import Convolution2D
```
**Step1**
To initialise the cnn model in this we stack layer sequentially

```python
classifier = Sequential() #to initialise
```
**Step2**
Then after that we do convolution of the image matrix with the 
feature detector in this i have taken feature detector of 32*32 and 3 there for RGB color.
**Relu** is used as a non-linear activator for image detection as we want to break linearity.

```python
classifier.add(Convolution2D( 32,32,3, input_shape=(64,64,3), activation='relu'))
```
**Step3**
Now comes the pooling as we want to decrease the size of our input 
image as only some features of the image are useful to us so we will apply max pooling with 2*2 matrix.
 
```python
classifier.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)))
```
**Step4**
To convert our matrix into vector to make it input into our neural network we do flattening.

```python
classifier.add(Flatten())
```
**Step5**
Now comes the portion of making full connection we use Dense function to do it

```python
classifier.add(Dense(output_dim = 128,activation = 'relu'))
```
**Step5**
As we only need to classify only two wether cat or dog we have used sigmoid function
```python
classifier.add(Dense(output_dim = 1,activation = 'sigmoid'))
```

To improve our accuracy we need to decrease our loss function so i have compiled it for 25 times
This tempelate is taken from keras documentation under image preprocessing section for 
augmentation purpose so that our model recognises the image correctly even if the image is distorted or misoriented. 
It helps us to gain more information from some amount of data
```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
        rescale=1./255,
        shear_range=0.2,
        zoom_range=0.2,
        horizontal_flip=True)

test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)

training_set = train_datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/training_set',target_size=(64, 64),batch_size=32,class_mode='binary')

test_set = test_datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/test_set',target_size=(64,64),batch_size=32,class_mode='binary')

classifier.fit_generator(
        training_set,
        steps_per_epoch=8000,
        epochs=25,
        validation_data=test_set,
        validation_steps=800)
```
