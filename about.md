  Feel free to check our other parts of the website, too! I'm currently working on adding more content, in the form of additional projects, a blog, and a home page revamp. So there's more to look forward to. :)

### Me

Hi, I'm Akshay Kwatra.

I hail from India. I am currently doing Bachelors(penultimate) in ECE From NIT Kurukshetra.

I use statistics and machine learning to solve analytics problems, and incorporating predictive models, *Drive*. You do need good storytelling for good data. ;)

I'm also <em>really</em> into indie rock, creative writing, travelling, and caffeine. I cycle between other hobbies as well, with the change of seasons.

Python • R • C++ • SQL • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Pandas • Numpy

Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Analytics, Statistical Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, Database Systems & Information Modelling  <em>and more!</em>

Thankfully, I'm not a cat.
